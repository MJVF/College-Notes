# Probability Density Function

- For _continuous RV_ the probability that $X=x$ is zero.
- Instead we seek the probability that $X$ falls within an interval $a \lt X \lt b$

- The probability that the conintuous RV $X$, is between a and b corresponds to the area under the curve representing the #Probability_Density_Function between the limits a and b.
- For discrete RV it was a sum off $\sum P(X=x_{i})$

### Properties of PDF
1. $f(x) \gt 0$, for all x in S.
2. The area under the curve $f(x)$ in the support S is 1, that is: $\int_{s}f(x)dx=1$
3. If $f(x)$ is the #PDF  of x, then the probability that x belongs to some interval, is given by the integral of $f(x)$ over that interval is:
$$P(x \in A) = \int_{A}f(x)dx$$

>__*EXAMPLE 1:*__
>Let $f(x) = 3x^{2}$ for $0 \lt x \lt 1$
> 1. Verify that $f(x)$ is a valid PDF
> 2. Calculate $P(\frac{1}{2} \lt X \lt 1)$ _and_ $P(X=\frac{1}{2})$

 x+y = \begin{cases} \mbox{true,} & \mbox{if } 0 < x < 5 \\ \mbox{false,} & \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}

# CDF

continuous random variable is the integration over the ragne of the random value by the range of the vlaue over the pdf
expected vlaue of the fuction is calculate dby replacing the x with the function of the x




#Probability_Density_Function is not a probability, but is used for probability! Integrating across all values equals 1. Variables are continuous. 
- Take a range of continuous random values and integrate the probability density function over the range to find the probability that a random variable will take a value within the range.

#Cumulative_Distribution_Function probability that your random variable is going to take a vlaue less than your expected values. It ranges from 0 $\rightarrow$ 1. Values greater than 1 are a sure event. Values less than 0 are impossibilities. 

#Expected_Value is the mean of all possible results for an infinite number of trials. Average of the values weighted by their probabilities. It is a _constant_. #Mean  ^2ca8c8
