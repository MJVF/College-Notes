# Random Signals

- In telecommunications we deal with random signals.
	- The mesage is a random signal (deterministic signals do not carry information)
	- The noise added to the signal in the transmitter, channel, and receiver is random. (e.g _thermal noise caused by random motion of electrons_)
	- The interference added to the signal is random.
- It is impossible to predict the precise value of random signals.

# Set Theory

> A #Set is a collection of _distinct objects_.
> A set can be defined by describing the contents, or by listing the elemtns of the set, enclosed in curly brackets.
> 	- {1, 3, 9, 12}


## De Morgan's Law

> Relate the intersecion and union of sets through complements.

> __*EXAMPLE 1:*__
> The class registrations of 120 students are analysed. It is found that:

# Probability Theory

- Probability and Statistics are concerned 

$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (\frac{N_{n}A}{n})$$



## Law of total Pobability
- if $A_{i}$ (i-1 to M) are mutually exclusie and exhaustive, the probability of any other event B ocuring is:
$$P(B) = P(B|A_{1})\cdot P(A_{1})+...+P(B|A_{M})\cdot P(A_{M})$$
