multiply the probability and the value for each x, and sum them. #Mean 

#### page 5
moments can have $n^{th}$ order. take the value of your random variable and raise it the the power of n. summation for deiscrete, integral for continuous.

#### page 6
take how far the random variable is from your mean.

#### page 7
moment is a measure or description of a shape of a distribution. 
#Skewed #Skewness 
moment vs central moment, distance form the mean, and the mean, respectively.

2 and $\mu$ are constants so theyre taken out. $\mu^{2}$ is also a constant so take it out.
[[13 -#^2ca8c8|expected value]]of X is equal to $\mu$
