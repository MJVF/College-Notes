# Types of Sampling

&nbsp;

## Simple Random Sample

^a3d9f6

> A #Sample is a __Simple Random Sample__ (SRS) if the probability of picking any collection of n units from the sampling frame as a sample does not depend on the collection of units.
>
> $\quad$ i.e. individuals are picked completely at random from the population.

- __*Advantages:*__
	1. Simple.
	2. If the sampling frame is appropriate, then there is no sampling bias.
- __*Disadvantages:*__
	1. If the population can be divided into units called strata, which have different characteristics, more precision can be obtained by using a #Stratified_Random_Sample .

## Stratified Random Sample

^ea33aa

> The population is divided into #Strata according to various characteristics, e.g _sex, occupation, age._
> $\quad$A #Simple_Random_Sample  is taken from each _stratum_, so that the proportions of individuals taken from each _stratum_ equals the proportion of individuals in the population as a whole within that stratum.

- __*Advantages:*__
	1. If the sampling frame is appropriate and the proportions of individuals in each stratum known, then there is no [[1 - Data Collection#Accuracy of Estimates|sampling bias]].
	2. If the strata are different in their characteristics, this method leads to increased precision.
- __*Disadvantages:*__
	1. Complexity, increased time required to collect samples.
	2. The proportions of individuals in each stratum should be known accurately for the method to be effective.

## Systematic Sampling

> Suppose we wish to #Sample a fraction, $1 \over k$, of the population. One individual is chosen from the first $k$ units listed in the [[1 - Data Collection#Sampling|sampling frame]], and each $k$ <sup>th</sup> individual is chosen from onwards.
> $\quad$ i.e If I want to choose ~$33\%$ of the population, I may choose number 2 from the first 3, then numbers 2, 5, 8, ..... are also picked. (See image below)

- __*Advantages:*__
	1. Same as [[#Simple Random Sample|simple random]] strategies.
- __*Disadvantages:*__
	1. More difficult to control the precision if the list is not ordered randomly with respect to the variables of interest. _For example_, if one wanted to study earnings in a given population , it would be reasonable to choose subjects from an alphabetic list using systematic sampling. _However_ it would not be reasonable to choose the subjects in such a way from a list of highest earners. (i.e. with the highest earners at the top)

## Convenience Sampling

> A __Convenience Sample__ is a sample in which the individuals are easily obtained and not based on randomness.
> The sample is chosen so as to minimise the costs of obtaining a sample, i.e. questioning friends and colleagues, inviting volunteers etc.

- __*Advantages:*__
	1. Simplicity.
	2. Low Sampling costs.
- __*Disadvantages:*__
	- The sample may _not be representative_ (i.e. there is [[1 - Data Collection#Accuracy of Estimates|sampling bias]]). _For example_, if we invite respondents to a study on the mathematical abilities of students, mathematically gifted individuals are more likely to volunteer than non-gifted individuals.

$nbsp;

## Expert Sampling

> An _expert_ chooses a sample that he feels is representative of the population as a whole.

- __*Advantages:*__
	- If the method employed by the expert is appropriate, this may well result in increased precision.
- __*Disadvantages:*__
	- __An inappropriate method will lead to bias.__

# Categorisation of Different Sampling Methods

> Sampling methods can be more broadly defined into [[5 - Probability|Probability]] and __Non-Probability__ sampling.
> __Probability sampling__ occurs when the probability that an individual is picked to be in a #Sample does not depend on the individual.
> The first __3__ methods described above ([[#Simple Random Sample|Simple]], [[#Stratified Random Sample|Stratified]], [[#Systematic Sampling|Systematic]]) are forms of probability sampling.

__*Note:*__ Stratified random sampling is a form of probability sampling as long as the _correct proportions_ of individuals in the various strata are known.

Such methods are advantageous as much can be said about the distribution of the statistics obtained from such a sample.
